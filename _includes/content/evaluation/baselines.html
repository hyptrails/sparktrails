<h3>Baselines</h3>
While a <a href="https://github.com/psinger/HypTrails">standard Python implementation</a> exists,
we use a custom, simplified Python implementation as a baseline.
The original implementation is flexible with regard to several special cases
and allows to use specialized storage mechanisms for large observation and hypothesis matrices.
However, in our evaluation scenario, we found this implementation to be slow 
in comparison to our custom, simplified version.
Thus, for evaluating SparkTrails, we use this simplified version,
which will be available on GitHub.
