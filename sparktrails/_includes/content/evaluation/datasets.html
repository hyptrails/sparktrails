<h3>Datasets</h3>
<p>
	In the SparkTrails paper, we use several datasets to evaluate the 
	runtime of our approach.
	This includes several synthetic datasets, a Wikipedia dataset and a Flickr dataset 
	aimed at demonstrating the scalability of SparkTrails.
	In this section we elaborate on these datasets.

<p>
	Generally, HypTrails works with trails on a finite set of states
	in a Markov chain scenario of order 1.
	Thus, each evaluation dataset is made up of two matrices: 
	an <strong>observation matrix</strong> and a <strong>hypothesis matrix</strong>.
	The observation matrix contains the number observation for each state transition
	and the hypothesis matrix contains the transition probabilities between states
	according to a user hypothesis.
