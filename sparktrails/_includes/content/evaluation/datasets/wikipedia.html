<h4>Wikipedia Dataset</h4>
<p>
	The Wikipedia datasets (<em>w<sub>self</sub> and w<sub>nw</sub></em>) is based on transitions between Wikipedia articles.
</p>
<p>
	The <strong>observation matrix</strong> for both datasets (<em>w<sub>self</sub> and w<sub>nw</sub></em>)
	contains transition counts extracted from the logs of 
	the desktop version of Wikipedia from Feb 2015 [1] by Wulczyn and Taraborelli.
	Log entries identified to be from spiders and bots are not included.
	Transition that occur less than 10 times in the logs are removed.
	The dataset contains transitions with articles from the main namespace 
	as but also includes incoming traffic from external sources.
	For our experiments, we discard the latter.
</p>
<p>
	For the "self" dataset (<em>w<sub>self</sub></em>), we reuse the observation matrix
	as <strong>hypothesis matrix</strong>.
</p>
<p>
	For the network dataset (<em>w<sub>nw</sub></em>), the <strong>hypothesis matrix</strong> 
	uses the underlying link network created from the links between the articles 
	in the XML Dump of the English Wikipedia from 4<sup>th</sup> of March 2015.
	The transition probability between a state <em>i</em> and a state <em>j</em>
	is equal to 0 if there is no link and 1 over the number of outgoing links of state <em>i</em> otherwise.
